# Blade-Ball-FFlags
I'm sharing my custom Blade Ball FFlag configuration, which includes a working Lagball and smoother graphics.

To use it, I’ll paste the contents of the file here (named "Blade Ball FFlag.json"). You can either download the file or copy the FFlags manually.

To apply the configuration, you'll need Bloxstrap. If you don't have it yet, download it from this link:
[Bloxstrap](https://bloxstrap.org/)

Setup Instructions:
1.Install Bloxstrap and launch it.

2.Click on "Configure Settings".

3.Go to "Engine Settings".

4.Scroll down and click on "Fast Flag Editor".

5.Press "Add New", then select "Import JSON".

6.If you copied the FFlags instead of downloading the file, paste them manually.

7.If you downloaded the file, choose "Import from file" and select the JSON file.

8.If a message appears saying "You appear to be importing a very large configuration", click "Yes".

9.Click "Save".

That’s it !
If you run into any issues, feel free to reach out. :)
